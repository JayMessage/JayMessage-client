# JayMessage-client
Open-source client for JPay, written in Python.

_This project is not associated with JPay LLC. or Securus Technologies LLC._

This program uses JPay's API to retrieve messages, check stamps, and more.

## Features

Currently, JayMessage doesn't do much besides read messages, but we intend to support the same features the official JPay app does.

| Features               | JayMessage | JPay App |
|------------------------|------------|----------|
| Viewing mail           | ✔️          | ✔️        |
| Sending mail           | ❌(planned) | ✔️        |
| Downloading mail       | ❌(planned) | ❌        |
| Viewing VideoGrams     | ❌(planned) | ✔️        |
| Downloading VideoGrams | ❌(planned) | ❌        |

Once the desktop Python version is stable and reaches feature-parity with the official JPay app, we'd like to release for mobile platforms, such as Android.
